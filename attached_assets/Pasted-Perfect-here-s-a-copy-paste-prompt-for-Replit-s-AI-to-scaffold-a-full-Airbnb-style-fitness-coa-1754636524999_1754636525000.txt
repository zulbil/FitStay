Perfect—here’s a **copy-paste prompt** for Replit’s AI to scaffold a full **Airbnb-style fitness coach directory**. It’s written like a senior full-stack spec so the AI knows exactly what to build.

---

**Replit AI Prompt (paste this verbatim):**

> Build a production-ready web app called **CoachBnB** — an Airbnb-style directory for booking fitness coaches by location and specialty.
>
> **Tech stack**
>
> * Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript, Server Actions)
> * Tailwind CSS + Headless UI + Lucide icons
> * Prisma ORM with SQLite for dev (easy to swap to Postgres)
> * NextAuth.js (email magic link only; credentials for demo)
> * Zod for input validation
> * Vercel/Edge-friendly patterns (no server-only libs that break)
>
> **Design**
>
> * Look/feel inspired by Airbnb: clean whitespace, large search header, card grid, rounded corners, subtle shadows, generous padding, responsive.
> * Tailwind design tokens, components, and utilities that mirror Airbnb spacing/typography.
>
> **Pages (App Router)**
>
> * `/` Home: sticky top search, hero with location/specialty/date inputs, featured coaches carousel, “popular specialties” chips, card grid of coaches with pagination.
> * `/search` Results: left filters (location, specialty, price range, in-person/virtual), sort (rating, price, newest), responsive grid of CoachCards, server-side pagination.
> * `/coach/[slug]` Coach profile: hero banner, avatar, name, badges (specialties), city, intro/bio, pricing tiles, availability widget (mocked), gallery, reviews list, CTA (“Contact / Book” opens modal form).
> * `/for-coaches` Selling page for coaches: benefits, pricing tiers (Free Directory / Pro Profile), comparison table, “Get Listed” button.
> * `/auth/*` Sign in/up screens (NextAuth).
> * `/dashboard` (protected): for coaches—edit profile, photos, specialties, pricing, availability (mock), view inquiries.
>
> **Data models (Prisma)**
>
> ```prisma
> model User {
>   id        String  @id @default(cuid())
>   email     String  @unique
>   name      String?
>   role      Role    @default(USER) // USER | COACH | ADMIN
>   coach     Coach?
>   createdAt DateTime @default(now())
> }
>
> enum Role { USER COACH ADMIN }
>
> model Coach {
>   id           String   @id @default(cuid())
>   userId       String   @unique
>   user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
>   slug         String   @unique
>   headline     String
>   bio          String
>   city         String
>   country      String
>   lat          Float?
>   lng          Float?
>   specialties  Specialty[] // m2m
>   pricePerHour Int
>   virtualOnly  Boolean   @default(false)
>   ratingAvg    Float     @default(0)
>   ratingCount  Int       @default(0)
>   photos       Photo[]
>   reviews      Review[]
>   createdAt    DateTime  @default(now())
>   updatedAt    DateTime  @updatedAt
> }
>
> model Specialty {
>   id      String   @id @default(cuid())
>   name    String   @unique
>   coaches Coach[]  @relation(references: [id])
> }
>
> model Photo {
>   id       String  @id @default(cuid())
>   coachId  String
>   url      String
>   order    Int     @default(0)
>   coach    Coach   @relation(fields: [coachId], references: [id])
> }
>
> model Review {
>   id        String  @id @default(cuid())
>   coachId   String
>   author    String
>   rating    Int
>   comment   String
>   createdAt DateTime @default(now())
>   coach     Coach   @relation(fields: [coachId], references: [id])
> }
> ```
>
> **Core components**
>
> * `Navbar` (sticky), `Footer`.
> * `SearchBar` (location autocomplete text input, specialty select, min/max price); submits to `/search` via server action.
> * `CoachCard`: photo, name, city, rating, specialties chips, price; entire card clickable.
> * `FilterPanel`: collapsible on mobile; checkboxes for specialties, slider for price, switches for virtualOnly; server actions update URL params.
> * `ProfileHeader`, `PhotoGallery`, `PricingTiles`, `ReviewList`, `ContactModal`.
>
> **Features**
>
> * Seed script: create 20 specialties and 40 demo coaches with photos from `picsum.photos` and realistic bios/prices. Random ratings/reviews.
> * Search & filters are server-side (read from URL params) and cached; pagination with `limit/offset`.
> * Contact/Inquiry form: posts to server action, validates with Zod, stores inquiry in SQLite and logs to console (stub for email).
> * Simple role-based access: coaches can edit only their profile via `/dashboard`.
> * Basic SEO: metadata per page, coach `slug`, Open Graph tags.
>
> **Styling details**
>
> * Tailwind config: rounded-2xl, shadow-md, tracking-tight, container max-w-\[1200px].
> * Reusable UI primitives: `Badge`, `Chip`, `Button`, `Card`, `Skeleton`.
> * Airbnb-like card hover: subtle scale and shadow.
>
> **Nice-to-haves (implement if quick)**
>
> * Debounced search in the header.
> * “Save to favorites” (client-only, localStorage).
> * Skeleton loaders for cards and profile sections.
>
> **Deliverables**
>
> * Fully running Next.js project with `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`.
> * Prisma schema + seed script (`prisma migrate dev && prisma db seed`).
> * README with setup steps.
> * Clear TODO comments where integrations (email, maps, payments) would go.
>
> After scaffolding, generate:
>
> 1. a README with setup instructions,
> 2. a short “Architecture Overview” section,
> 3. seed data script,
> 4. example `.env.local` values for NextAuth/Prisma.
>    Keep everything minimal, clean, and Airbnb-inspired.

### How to use it (super quick)

1. Create a new Replit → **Next.js + Node** template.
2. Open the AI/ghostwriter panel → paste the prompt above.
3. After generation:

   * `npm i` (or `pnpm i`)
   * `npx prisma migrate dev`
   * `npx prisma db seed`
   * `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`, test search/filters, tweak copy and colors.

Want me to also write seed specialties (e.g., Hypertrophy, Weight Loss, Mobility, Powerlifting, Prenatal, Sports Performance, etc.) and a polished home hero headline? I can drop those in next.
